       *  Read all the record from the permenant file, If the data matches then it will store in temporary file the rest record wil store  it in permemant file
       *  After that we need to remove the original file and then rename the temp file name to original file name

   * Exit record: 
       * After completion of the usage of software you can exit the application by typing an option '6'
